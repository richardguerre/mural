        speechGuidance: "Use clear, natural Standard Mandarin pronunciation. Treat tones, tone changes, retroflex and non-retroflex sounds, and distinctions between initials and finals as meaningful when they affect understanding. Accept valid regional accents and vocabulary without treating a regional difference or a non-native accent alone as an error. Do not imitate a regional caricature.",
        writingGuidance: "Use natural Simplified Chinese and standard modern punctuation. Prefer everyday Mainland usage while accepting valid regional wording. Keep Chinese text free of unnecessary spaces and explain characters, pinyin and tones when they help the learner.",
        lemmaGuidance: "Give vocabulary in commonly used simplified characters, with pinyin and a short plain-English meaning when useful. Use the dictionary form of verbs and preserve measure words, aspect markers and meaningful separable verbs such as 洗澡 and 见面 in context.",
